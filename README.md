# BetterTaskMgr
An improved version of the windows 10 task manager.

**Features that TaskMgr doesn't have**  
* ðŸŒ™ Dark Mode
* âœ¨ A more futuristic looking interface
* ðŸ¥š Easter eggs? Well I mean... maybe
* ðŸ’» M O D E R N

BetterTaskMgr was made in Electron. Electron is also used in other applications like 
Discord, WhatsApp Destop, Slack and even Visual Studio Code, which is used to make this.

BetterTaskMgr may have some downsides compared to the windows 10 task manager, 
but we will always try our best to improve it for matching results.

*The programming was done by Kenan238, and a tiny bit of help from me.*
